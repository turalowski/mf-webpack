## Brief information

Scope of this application is to serve cart and products apps and use them in container app. I used webpack to share the modules. In addition to regular functions, `faker` package is used to see how dependency sharing works in microfrontends

## Running the applications

1. Run products app:

```bash
cd products && npm run start
```

2. Run cart app:

```bash
cd cart && npm run start
```

3. Run the container:

```bash
cd container && npm run start
```
